- define a function 'crow_plugin()'
- make it return a list of 3 strings:
  - ["build command", "run command", "test command"]

the build command should only compile the project
set to 'NONE' if this is not available e.g. interpreted languages

the run command will build (if applicable) the project, and run the output.

the test command will obviously run tests on the project

in the plugin function, you can do things like:
- load commands from a config file e.g. package.json for nodejs
- fetch dependencies, e.g. pip or node modules
